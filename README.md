# Todo List App

TODO Daily is an intuitive and user-friendly Todo List application that is built using React. With its simple yet effective features, users can easily add, edit, and delete tasks as per their needs. This application also allows users to mark their tasks as completed or incomplete, giving them a clear picture of their progress. Additionally, tasks can be assigned a priority level of low, medium, or high, and each priority level has its distinct color code (low for green, medium for yellow, and high for red) to indicate the task's importance in the list. The application also provides Firebase authentication, ensuring that only registered and authenticated users can access and utilize its features. Overall, TODO Daily is a comprehensive and reliable application that can help users stay on top of their daily tasks and achieve their goals efficiently.
